# Working with Imbalance DataÂ 
This syntax is for resolving imbalance data with the undersampling and oversampling method.
Unbalanced data is a condition where the distribution of data classes does not have the same proportions, the number of data class targets (target variables) is one less or one more than the number of other data class targets.
As we know, the smaller data class target group is known as the minority group and the other data class target group is called the majority group.
