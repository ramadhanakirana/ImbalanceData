# Working with Imbalance DataÂ 
This syntax is for resolving imbalance data with the undersampling and oversampling method.
Unbalanced data is a condition where the distribution of data classes does not have the same proportions, the number of data class targets (target variables) is one less or one more than the number of other data class targets.
As we know, the smaller data class target group is known as the minority group and the other data class target group is called the majority group.

There are two ways to die from a data imbalance. We can add data or do resampling. In this section, I will talk about resampling. There are two types of resampling: undersampling (taking a sample in such a way that the proportion of the majority class is smaller than the original proportion) and oversampling (taking the minority class in such a way that its proportion in the sample is greater than the original proportion).
